# P2P Encrypted Chat

An educational peer-to-peer encrypted messaging system built from raw Python TCP sockets — custom message framing, persistent cryptographic identities, fingerprint-based peer authentication, encrypted local history, peer discovery via a cloud rendezvous server, and a measured NAT traversal experiment.

This is **not** a WebRTC/PeerJS wrapper. Every layer — framing, encryption, identity, storage, discovery — is built and understood from the socket up.

## What It Does

| Capability | Proof |
|---|---|
| Two peers chat E2E-encrypted | Verified on two physical laptops over LAN, recorded on video |
| Identity survives restarts | Same fingerprint (`c849:a2b7...`) across every session of the build |
| History persists, encrypted at rest | Restart → history reloads and decrypts; raw SQL shows only ciphertext |
| Peer discovery by name | `find aadarsh` → endpoint + fingerprint, worked across two Indian carrier networks + Azure |
| Cross-network discovery over the real Internet | Rendezvous hosted on an Azure VM; peers on home Wi-Fi (Delhi) + mobile hotspot registered and looked each other up |
| Fingerprint verification | Both sides display fingerprints; out-of-band comparison; pre-connect verification via the registry |

## Demo

🎥 Two physical laptops chatting over LAN, disconnect → reconnect → history reloads.

| Fingerprint verification across two screens | Rendezvous log: two peers, two public NAT IPs | Punch verdict on CGNAT |
|---|---|---|
| The out-of-band fingerprint check, side by side | The registry holding two different public NAT mappings (home Wi-Fi + mobile hotspot) — discovery across the real Internet | Control pass on loopback vs. failure on real CGNAT |

```

Every layer of the transport stack is implemented, not imported:

```text
Application (chat, history)
 ↓
Peer management (listen / connect / find / punch modes)
 ↓
Cryptographic identity (persistent keypairs, fingerprints)
 ↓
PyNaCl Box (X25519 key exchange + XSalsa20-Poly1305 AEAD)
 ↓
Custom framing ([4-byte big-endian length][payload])
 ↓
TCP sockets (blocking, threaded receive)
 ↓
IP / NAT / firewall
```

Local storage is a separate concern from transport: every message is passed through `SecretBox.encrypt` before being written to a SQLite `BLOB`, using a storage key that is distinct from the transport identity key.

## Usage

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd p2p-chat
pip install pynacl

# terminal 1 — rendezvous server (or point at the deployed one)
python rendezvous_server.py                 # port 7000

# terminal 2 — peer A, discoverable by name
python peer.py listen 9999 aadarsh <rv_ip>

# terminal 3 — peer B finds and connects
python peer.py find aadarsh <rv_ip>
python peer.py connect <aadarsh-ip> 9999 ishu

# NAT traversal attempt (coordinated simultaneous open)
python peer.py punch <my_id> <peer_id> <my_port> <rv_ip>
```

Once connected, both sides display their fingerprints. Compare them out-of-band (e.g. a phone call) before trusting the session. Type `quit` to exit — history reloads automatically the next time you connect to the same peer.

## The NAT Traversal Experiment

This is the centerpiece of the V1 build: a real, measured attempt at direct P2P connectivity across the open Internet — not a simulated or hand-waved result.

**Setup:** Rendezvous server on an Azure VM (Central India). Peer A on home Wi-Fi (`192.168.1.8` local, NAT public `122.162.151.183`). Peer B on a phone hotspot (`10.197.183.135` local behind carrier-grade NAT, NAT public `157.49.119.123`).

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Baseline: uncoordinated direct dial across the Internet | ❌ `WinError 10060` timeout (~20s) — NAT drops the unsolicited inbound SYN |
| Control: simultaneous open on loopback | ✅ Punched through — hole-punching mechanics proven correct |
| Simultaneous open, home NAT ↔ Airtel CGNAT, 60s | ❌ Neither NAT delivered the peer's SYNs |

**Conclusion:** the code is correct (the loopback control passes); the network refuses. Carrier-grade NAT shares one public IP across thousands of subscribers with endpoint-dependent mapping, which direct TCP hole punching cannot reliably defeat. This is a measured failure, explained at the NAT level, not a bug.

**Fallback strategy (documented, V2):** a relay forwards already-encrypted traffic. The rendezvous/relay server never holds keys — by construction, it doesn't even have PyNaCl installed, so the "phone book" literally cannot read messages even if it wanted to.

## Security Model

**Protects against:**
- Passive network observers (end-to-end AEAD encryption)
- Peer impersonation across reconnects (persistent identities + fingerprint verification)
- Plaintext history on disk (SQLite holds only ciphertext)
- IP changes redefining identity (history is keyed by fingerprint, not IP)

**Does NOT protect against:**
- **No forward secrecy** — static-static ECDH means a later key compromise exposes previously recorded traffic; there is no ratchet
- Unencrypted key files at rest
- Replay attacks (no counters or nonces yet)
- A malicious rendezvous server serving the wrong endpoint (fingerprint comparison mitigates this, but Trust-On-First-Use doesn't eliminate it)
- Traffic analysis / metadata leakage
- Machine compromise
- `peer_id` squatting — names aren't yet bound to keys (V2 pins names to the first-registered key)
- Implementation bugs not yet found

This is an educational project. **Do not use it for sensitive real-world communications.**

## Testing

19 automated tests across 3 files, running in ~0.53s:

- **`test_protocol.py` (8 tests):** roundtrips (small/empty/binary-256), back-to-back frames in one burst, fragmented delivery (header split mid-stream), 1 MiB through a threaded reader, clean-FIN → `None`, RST → `None` (regression for the M13 shutdown bug, reproduced via `SO_LINGER(0)`)
- **`test_storage.py` (6 tests):** roundtrip, insertion order (locks `ORDER BY id`), per-fingerprint isolation, message direction, ciphertext-at-rest (reads the raw SQL like an attacker would), wrong key → `CryptoError` (regression for the M12 key-orphaning incident)
- **`test_identity.py` (5 tests):** key persistence, distinct identities, fingerprint stability across reloads, fingerprint format contract (16×4 hex groups; stripping colons = raw SHA-256), `SecretBox` key size

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
# 19 passed in ~0.5s
```

## Bugs Found (and Fixed) Along the Way

Each of these was caught by the test suite or a real run, and each is now guarded against:

- **`Peer.py` vs `peer.py`** — Windows case-insensitivity masked this; caught on the first test run and would have broken on Linux/macOS
- **Windows `Ctrl+C` sends RST, not FIN** — the receive thread crashed with `ConnectionResetError`; fixed by treating `OSError` as EOF everywhere in `recv_message`, giving one consistent failure convention
- **Daemon thread killed mid-print at shutdown** (`Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy`) — fixed by joining the receiver thread with a 2s timeout before exit
- **Phantom "Peer disconnected" on your own `quit`** — fixed with an `if connected:` guard
- **Storage-key rename orphaned encrypted history** — surfaces as a loud `CryptoError` by design; now locked by a regression test
- **`ORDER BY timestamp` scrambled messages at second-granularity** — switched to `ORDER BY id`
- **Fingerprint gate was exact-match and rejected `"y"`** — fixed with an explicit allowlist (`yes`/`y`); anything else still fails closed
- **Punch-mode split-brain connections** — fixed with identity-proof at accept: a connection must present the public key matching the registry fingerprint, or it's dropped
- **Windows failed-socket reuse** — fixed by using a fresh socket per punch attempt
- **`get_lan_ip()` originally used a TCP socket** — it would open a real connection to `8.8.8.8:80` (hanging ~20s when unreachable) instead of doing a route lookup — replaced with a UDP socket, which never sends a packet
- **Rendezvous lookup race** — fixed with a 20s retry loop so start order no longer matters
- **Python block-buffers stdout when redirected**, causing empty logs on an otherwise healthy server — fixed by running with `python3 -u`

## Infrastructure Notes

Real cloud/ops lessons from deploying the rendezvous server:

- **Azure for Students** has region allowlist restrictions (`RequestDisallowedByAzure`) and a B-series vCPU quota of 0 in some regions; worked around with a `B2ats_v2` instance (~$0.0062/hr). No auto-shutdown was available in-region, so a manual portal-stop discipline plus a $15 budget alert was used instead.
- Two independent firewall layers must both be opened for the server to be reachable: the cloud Network Security Group **and** the OS-level `ufw`.
- A VM restart kills running processes but not files, so the server is started with `nohup python3 -u rendezvous_server.py &` every time; `pgrep` is checked first to avoid stale double instances (which caused a confusing false failure once).
- MinTTY/Git Bash swallows `Ctrl+C` for console-less programs — use `winpty`.
- The VM's public IP can change on deallocate, so it's always re-read from the Azure portal rather than assumed.
- The rendezvous server records the **observed** source IP of a connecting peer (which can't be lied to) alongside the **peer-advertised** listen port (which it has no way to independently verify). Registering via `127.0.0.1` poisons the registry — the same observed-vs-advertised mechanism is what later reveals real NAT public mappings.

## Roadmap (V2)

- **Relay implementation** — the fallback for when punching fails; already-encrypted traffic is relayed, and the rendezvous server is upgraded to hand out relay info. This is what makes cross-Internet chat work reliably, not just when NAT cooperates.
- **Packaging** — a `pyproject.toml` and a PyPI release, so usage becomes `pip install <name>` followed by `p2pchat listen --name aadarsh` / `p2pchat connect aadarsh`, with no files, ports, or internals exposed to the end user.
- **Auto-fallback chain** — direct → punch → relay, orchestrated by a connection state machine.
- **Name pinning** — first registration binds a `peer_id` to a public key, closing the squatting gap.
- **Hardening** — `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`, replay counters, heartbeats/timeouts, and key-file permissions.
